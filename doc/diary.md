Group - original idea: comparing great walks, covid, tourism and weather

Seth - Tried scraping tourism data using the stats nz ami but it wouldnt work properly, also tried scraping from the webpage but it would not play ball
 
Jamie - Imported and looked at the StatsNZ DOC great walk bookings data.
                Started manipulating the data (Made it wide, looked at overbooking)
                
Group - gave up on original idea of comparing great walks with tourism, weather, and covid and decided on doing comparing the CPI and shipping costs with covid
